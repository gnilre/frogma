 Ok, here it is! The "final" candidate of my ProTracker music player for Java.
 This player is highly accurate, has very good sound quality, and is very fast.

 Quick Start:
   java MicroModPlayer modfile.mod

 Features:
   Written in Java, using the Java 1.3 16 bit audio system.
   Designed for realtime single thread operation. Evenly distributed cpu usage.
   Plays NoiseTracker, ProTracker, and extended ProTracker formats.
   Supports most ProTracker effect commands. Only the crap ones are missing.
   Linear interpolation and FIR resampling filters for that smooth sound!
   Micro volume ramping to reduce clicks.
   Modulation effects other players simply miss. Designed for chip mods :)

 Version 0.99 will have some fixes, and should hopefully be out soon.
 Version 1.0 may be a while coming, but will be both accurate and portable.

 My tip for anyone doing OO programming: "Keep It Simple, Stupid!" ;)

 References:
   HAMCO Java module player. Port of S3MOD. Never got author to admit it :)
   Firelight's ProTracker MOD reference. Simply wrong! Very useful, though.
   Lars "Zap" Hamre and others mod-spec.txt. Invaluable.

 What next?:
   I'll start the XM player tomorrow! Honest!
